# F1 Live Timing Library for .NET #

A library for streaming and decoding the data from the _formula1.com_ live timing feed. Use it to build your own .NET applications for displaying timing information (and some other stuff) **live** during a Grand Prix.

Please visit the [Home Page](http://livetiming.turnitin.co.uk) for more information and documentation (to follow).

# Getting Started with the Code #
If you want help getting started, I recommend taking a look at the console app "LivetimingLogger" which demonstrates usage of the `LiveTiming` and `LiveTimingSimulator` interfaces in this library.
