Add references to the F1 and Common assemblies, and see the help file for an example for creating your first program harnessing the library.


Using the LivetimingLogger.exe
------------------------------

The live timing logger will connect to the servers on a race day and dump all the data it receives to a log file and to the stdout. 

To use it:

1) Copy "Copy me to auth.config" to "auth.config"
2) Modify the file to include your username and password for the formula1.com website
3) Run the exe in its current directory


Using the Live data capture.exe
-------------------------------

This application will connect to the live server and pull the data, storing it to a file which can then be used in your application for playback of an event.

To use it:

> Live data capture.exe capfile.dat
